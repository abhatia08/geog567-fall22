## Spatial Analysis of the Effects of Wildfires on Short- and Long-Term Health  in California using Google Earth Engine

This repository contains data and scripts used for the final project of [GEOG 567- Introduction to Remote Sensing](https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/geog/), at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  

### About 

Wildfires pose a significant danger to human health and wellbeing with both acute impacts on injury, displacement, fatalities, and interruption of services; and a long-term impact on population disease burden, and the environment. The impact of climate disasters is differential across population strata, and pregnant persons are especially vulnerable to the conditions both during and after; short-term, the displacement effects of wildfires coupled with service disruption interrupt access to critical care during late pregnancy. Through its effect on environmental air quality, wildfires also exert long-term impacts on pregnant people, with protracted exposure to higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels during late pregnancy being associated with lower birth weights and pre-term births.


**Objectives**

The state of California in the western United States has experienced increasingly severe drought conditions, and more frequent, severe (acute) wildfires. For the purposes of this analysis, we examine the short, and long-term effects of wildfires in California, USA, with an emphasis on the impact on air quality in surrounding areas, the immediate impacts on population displacement, and the long-term impact on maternal and child health.

## Project structure 

  - `./scripts/` contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the analysis. The scripts are intended to be run in order of their number.
  - `./source_data/` contains publicly-available data used in the analytic pipeline.
  - `./figures/` contains all the original source visualizations, and processed visualizations that result from the `./scripts/` pipeline.
  - `./derived_data/` contains all processed data that results from our `./scripts/` pipeline.
